| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| Hacker (not so much)<br />but we do consolidate information  | Money              | Malware<br />Phishing |
| Internal – acting for defence or prosecution (or other cases) want to segregate internally ("information barriers") | Passive, bias      |                       |
| Client (who owns the data – lines badly drawn)               | Passive, data loss |                       |
| Opposing side (but not come across)                          |                    |                       |
| Cloud providers – we do want search indexing, but want to rescind (hence private encryption key) |                    |                       |
| Governments – e.g. USA federal law for backdoor? "It's not in the US is it" |                    |                       |
