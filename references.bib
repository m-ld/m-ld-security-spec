  abstract = {Common approach of the threat modelling includes an analysis of computer system architecture on early stages of development process and creation of threat model. Data Flow Diagrams (DFD) are often used to represent the system organization. The main challenge with threat modelling is that there are no formal approaches to describe the computer system architecture and structured knowledge sources of threats and countermeasures. To overcome these restrictions we have created ontology-driven threat modelling (OdTM) framework based on base threat model, used to develop various domain-specific threat models. Each domain-specific threat model contains a set of typical components of some architectural domain, threats and countermeasures. A system architect describes its computer system with DFD diagram; then automatic reasoning procedures are used to semantically interpret the diagram and figure out relevant threats and countermeasures for the system. We approach a conception of context security patterns as countermeasures. Context security pattern contains a precise description of security problem and its solution. Also it has criteria that allow to automatically map it to system component. We propose three ways to integrate context security patterns with domain-specific threat models: with data flow templates, through association with threats, and the use of labels. All the models, discussed in this work, can be implemented as OWL (Web Ontology Language) ontologies with Description logics (DL) as a mathematical background.}

In this model, it is possible for replicas to be temporarily inconsistent, having  been proposed various solutions to deal with this inconsistency and ensure the final  convergence of data. However, defining and enforcing access control policies under this model is still an open challenge.  The implementation of access control policies for these systems raises it's own challenges, given the information about the permissions is itself kept in a weakly consistent form. In this dissertation, a solution for this problem is proposed, that allows to prevent the non authorized access and modification of data.  The proposed solution allows concurrent modifications on the security policies, ensuring their convergence when they are used to verify and enforce access control the associated data. In this dissertation we present an evaluation of the proposed model, showing the solution respects the correct functioning over possible challenging situations, also discussing its application on scenarios that feature peer-to-peer communication between clients and additional replicas on the clients, with the goal of providing a lower latency and reduce the load on centralized components.},

In such a setting, privacy has emerged as a key concern since companies often neglect or even misuse personal data. In response to multiple massive breaches of personal data, governments around the world have enacted laws and regulations for privacy protection. These laws dictate privacy requirements for any system that acquires and manages personal data. Unfortunately, these requirements are often incomplete and/or inaccurate as many RE practitioners are insufficiently versed with privacy requirements and how are they different from other requirements, such as security. To tackle this problem, we developed a comprehensive ontology for privacy requirements. In particular, the contributions of this work include the derivation of an ontology from a previously conducted systematic literature review, an implementation using an ontology definition tool (Prot\'eg\'e), a demonstration of its coverage through an extensive example on Ambient Assisted Living, and a validation through competency questions. Also, we evaluate the ontology against the common pitfalls for ontologies with the help of some software tools, lexical semantics experts, and privacy and security researchers. The ontology presented herein (COPri v.2) has been enhanced with extensions motivated by the feedback received from privacy and security experts.},

Until recently, there was no answer to the question of when coordination is actually required. In this paper we present an informal introduction to the CALM Theorem, which answers this question precisely by moving up from traditional storage consistency to consider properties of programs. CALM is an acronym for "consistency as logical monotonicity". The CALM Theorem shows that the programs that have consistent, coordination-free distributed implementations are exactly the programs that can be expressed in monotonic logic. This theoretical result has practical implications for developers of distributed applications. We show how CALM provides a constructive application-level counterpart to conventional "systems" wisdom, such as the apparently negative results of the CAP Theorem. We also discuss ways that monotonic thinking can influence distributed systems design, and how new programming language designs and tools can help developers write consistent, coordination-free code.},

The protocols underlying these apps provide much stronger security properties than earlier encryption systems such as PGP/GnuPG. This makes them an interesting basis for implementing CRDT-based data systems with end-to-end security: if we simply send all the CRDT operations or state updates via a secure messaging protocol, we inherit its strong security properties. However, there are lots of subtleties about the guarantees provided by secure messaging protocols: in particular, the properties that hold for communication between two parties often don't easily generalise to groups of more than two participants. This talk will summarise the current state of research in secure group messaging, and discuss how we can bring this work into the world of CRDTs.}

  abstract = {In this article we study the properties of distributed systems that mix eventual and strong consistency. We formalize such systems through acute cloud types (ACTs), abstractions similar to conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs), which by default work in a highly available, eventually consistent fashion, but which also feature strongly consistent operations for tasks which require global agreement. Unlike other mixed-consistency solutions, ACTs can rely on efficient quorum-based protocols, such as Paxos. Hence, ACTs gracefully tolerate machine and network failures also for the strongly consistent operations. We formally study ACTs and demonstrate phenomena which are neither present in purely eventually consistent nor strongly consistent systems. In particular, we identify temporary operation reordering, which implies interim disagreement between replicas on the relative order in which the client requests were executed. When not handled carefully, this phenomenon may lead to undesired anomalies, including circular causality. We prove an impossibility result which states that temporary operation reordering is unavoidable in mixed-consistency systems with sufficiently complex semantics. Our result is startling, because it shows that apparent strengthening of the semantics of a system (by introducing strongly consistent operations to an eventually consistent system) results in the weakening of the guarantees on the eventually consistent operations.},

With the rise of artificial legal intelligence, computable contracts \textendash{} and more broadly, computable law \textendash{} are making a powerful return. Contracts may be represented as computer data with terms made `machine-readable' through a process of conversion: from descriptive natural language to consonant computer instruction. Conditions of agreements are not explained but listed as structured data records. However, despite the capacity to express contracts in an alternative computable form, no means exist for interpreting the code. Rather, the interpretation of contractual obligations is perceived as irrelevant. Should digital data inscription and processing be considered a form of legal writing? If so, would it change the character of law? This paper considers the conundrum: what is the significance of the medium in contract drafting? The paper is, therefore, a thought experiment on the translation of text to numbers by unpacking several formal programming languages used in computable contracts. In identifying the logic of these languages, the paper studies methods of legal writing. The hypothesis is that, by analyzing the components of both legal and programming languages, we can develop a richer dialogue on the sociological implications of translating law into algorithmic form. Furthermore, we can begin to consider what contextual information would be required to `interpret' algorithmic contractual language.}

However, given the limited resources of devices, instead of encrypting all messages in the network, it is better to encrypt only the messages that if tampered with or injected, could lead to undesired configurations. This paper describes the use of formal verification to analyse the security of I4.0 applications.

A data type that satisfies these conditions is called a Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT). Replicas of any CRDT are guaranteed to converge in a self-stabilising manner, despite any number of failures. This paper formalises two popular approaches (state- and operation-based) and their relevant sufficient conditions. We study a number of useful CRDTs, such as sets with clean semantics, supporting both add and remove operations, and consider in depth the more complex Graph data type. CRDT types can be composed to develop large-scale distributed applications, and have interesting theoretical properties.},

Early analysis of security makes it possible to predict threats and their impacts and define adequate security requirements before the system is in place. Security requirements are difficult to elicit, analyze, and manage. The fact that analysts' knowledge about security is often tacit makes the task of security requirements elicitation even harder. Ontologies are known for being a good way to formalize knowledge. Ontologies, in particular, have been proved useful to support reusability. Requirements engineering based on predefined ontologies can make the job of requirement engineering much easier and faster. However, this very much depends on the quality of the ontology that is used. Some security ontologies for security requirements have been proposed in the literature. None of them stands out as complete. This paper presents a core and generic security ontology for security requirements engineering. Its core and generic status is attained thanks to its coverage of wide and high-level security concepts and relationships. We implemented the ontology and developed an interactive environment to facilitate the use of the ontology during the security requirements engineering process. The proposed security ontology was evaluated by checking its validity and completeness compared to other ontologies. Moreover, a controlled experiment with end-users was performed to evaluate its usability.},

  abstract = {Using a CRDT, users can collaborate in real-time editing of a shared document over a loosely connected P2P network. Each user will have a replica of the shared document and they will send each other messages signifying updates to the state (either in the form of operations, whole states or deltas). While CRDTs already make this possible, certain useful capabilities do not exist yet. For example, the owner of a document might want to collaborate with other uses, but still be able to maintain control of who can read or write to this document. Not only does the user want to protect their local replica but, in order to maintain consistency across peers, they also want to inform the other replicas of which users are allowed to do what. Besides having the power to adding permissions to users in all of the replicas, they might want to be able to remove these permissions and be able to also propagate this to the other replicas. Besides read and write access, this user may also want to delegate this power to other users, so that they also can become administrators of permissions for this given replica. Any of these permissions should also be revocable in the future. The initial owner will create a message describing this permission and propagate it to all the other users. When knowing this information, replica of user B will start making local changes, and those changes will be propagated to other replicas. If, while user B is propagating the replica, user A revokes this permission, how can this be accomplished in a way that is secure and that still guarantees SEC?},

  abstract = {The recent digital revolution led robots to become integrated more than ever into different domains such as agricultural, medical, industrial, military, police (law enforcement), and logistics. Robots are devoted to serve, facilitate, and enhance the human life. However, many incidents have been occurring, leading to serious injuries and devastating impacts such as the unnecessary loss of human lives. Unintended accidents will always take place, but the ones caused by malicious attacks represent a very challenging issue. This includes maliciously hijacking and controlling robots and causing serious economic and financial losses. This paper reviews the main security vulnerabilities, threats, risks, and their impacts, and the main security attacks within the robotics domain. In this context, different approaches and recommendations are presented in order to enhance and improve the security level of robotic systems such as multi-factor device/user authentication schemes, in addition to multi-factor cryptographic algorithms. We also review the recently presented security solutions for robotic systems.},
