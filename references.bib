  abstract = {Common approach of the threat modelling includes an analysis of computer system architecture on early stages of development process and creation of threat model. Data Flow Diagrams (DFD) are often used to represent the system organization. The main challenge with threat modelling is that there are no formal approaches to describe the computer system architecture and structured knowledge sources of threats and countermeasures. To overcome these restrictions we have created ontology-driven threat modelling (OdTM) framework based on base threat model, used to develop various domain-specific threat models. Each domain-specific threat model contains a set of typical components of some architectural domain, threats and countermeasures. A system architect describes its computer system with DFD diagram; then automatic reasoning procedures are used to semantically interpret the diagram and figure out relevant threats and countermeasures for the system. We approach a conception of context security patterns as countermeasures. Context security pattern contains a precise description of security problem and its solution. Also it has criteria that allow to automatically map it to system component. We propose three ways to integrate context security patterns with domain-specific threat models: with data flow templates, through association with threats, and the use of labels. All the models, discussed in this work, can be implemented as OWL (Web Ontology Language) ontologies with Description logics (DL) as a mathematical background.}

Intended for organizations that need to either build a risk management program from the ground up or strengthen an existing one, this book provides a unique and fresh perspective on how to do a basic quantitative risk analysis. Covering such key areas as risk theory, risk calculation, scenario modeling, and communicating risk within the organization, Measuring and Managing Information Risk helps managers make better business decisions by understanding their organizational risk.Uses factor analysis of information risk (FAIR) as a methodology for measuring and managing risk in any organization.Carefully balances theory with practical applicability and relevant stories of successful implementation.Includes examples from a wide variety of businesses and situations presented in an accessible writing style.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, most enterprises collect, store, and manage personal information of customers to deliver their services. In such a setting, privacy has emerged as a key concern since companies often neglect or even misuse personal data. In response to multiple massive breaches of personal data, governments around the world have enacted laws and regulations for privacy protection. These laws dictate privacy requirements for any system that acquires and manages personal data. Unfortunately, these requirements are often incomplete and/or inaccurate as many RE practitioners are insufficiently versed with privacy requirements and how are they different from other requirements, such as security. To tackle this problem, we developed a comprehensive ontology for privacy requirements. In particular, the contributions of this work include the derivation of an ontology from a previously conducted systematic literature review, an implementation using an ontology definition tool (Prot\'eg\'e), a demonstration of its coverage through an extensive example on Ambient Assisted Living, and a validation through competency questions. Also, we evaluate the ontology against the common pitfalls for ontologies with the help of some software tools, lexical semantics experts, and privacy and security researchers. The ontology presented herein (COPri v.2) has been enhanced with extensions motivated by the feedback received from privacy and security experts.},

  abstract = {Secure messaging apps like WhatsApp, Signal, and iMessage have brought end-to-end encryption to over 1 billion users. The protocols underlying these apps provide much stronger security properties than earlier encryption systems such as PGP/GnuPG. This makes them an interesting basis for implementing CRDT-based data systems with end-to-end security: if we simply send all the CRDT operations or state updates via a secure messaging protocol, we inherit its strong security properties. However, there are lots of subtleties about the guarantees provided by secure messaging protocols: in particular, the properties that hold for communication between two parties often don't easily generalise to groups of more than two participants. This talk will summarise the current state of research in secure group messaging, and discuss how we can bring this work into the world of CRDTs.}

  abstract = {Without appropriate counter-measures, cyber-attacks can exploit the increased system connectivity provided by Industry 4.0 (I4.0) to cause catastrophic events, by, e.g., injecting or tampering with messages. The solution supported by standards, such as, OPC-UA, is to sign or encrypt messages. However, given the limited resources of devices, instead of encrypting all messages in the network, it is better to encrypt only the messages that if tampered with or injected, could lead to undesired configurations. This paper describes the use of formal verification to analyse the security of I4.0 applications. We formalize in Rewriting Logic, I4.0 applications and systems, i.e., networked sets of devices, and a symbolic intruder model. Our formalization can be executed by the tool Maude to automate such security analysis, e.g., determine which messages are sufficient to sign in order avoid injection and tampering attacks.},

  abstract = {Security is an important issue that needs to be taken into account at all stages of information system development, including early requirements elicitation. Early analysis of security makes it possible to predict threats and their impacts and define adequate security requirements before the system is in place. Security requirements are difficult to elicit, analyze, and manage. The fact that analysts' knowledge about security is often tacit makes the task of security requirements elicitation even harder. Ontologies are known for being a good way to formalize knowledge. Ontologies, in particular, have been proved useful to support reusability. Requirements engineering based on predefined ontologies can make the job of requirement engineering much easier and faster. However, this very much depends on the quality of the ontology that is used. Some security ontologies for security requirements have been proposed in the literature. None of them stands out as complete. This paper presents a core and generic security ontology for security requirements engineering. Its core and generic status is attained thanks to its coverage of wide and high-level security concepts and relationships. We implemented the ontology and developed an interactive environment to facilitate the use of the ontology during the security requirements engineering process. The proposed security ontology was evaluated by checking its validity and completeness compared to other ontologies. Moreover, a controlled experiment with end-users was performed to evaluate its usability.},

The UCO ontology has also been mapped to a number of existing cybersecurity ontologies as well as concepts in the Linked Open Data cloud. Similar to DBpedia which serves as the core for general knowledge in Linked Open Data cloud, we envision UCO to serve as the core for cybersecurity domain, which would evolve and grow with the passage of time with additional cybersecurity data sets as they become available. We also present a prototype system and concrete use cases supported by the UCO ontology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first cybersecurity ontology that has been mapped to general world ontologies to support broader and diverse security use cases. We compare the resulting ontology with previous efforts, discuss its strengths and limitations, and describe potential future work directions.},

Robots are devoted to serve, facilitate, and enhance the human life. However, many incidents have been occurring, leading to serious injuries and devastating impacts such as the unnecessary loss of human lives. Unintended accidents will always take place, but the ones caused by malicious attacks represent a very challenging issue. This includes maliciously hijacking and controlling robots and causing serious economic and financial losses. This paper reviews the main security vulnerabilities, threats, risks, and their impacts, and the main security attacks within the robotics domain. In this context, different approaches and recommendations are presented in order to enhance and improve the security level of robotic systems such as multi-factor device/user authentication schemes, in addition to multi-factor cryptographic algorithms.
