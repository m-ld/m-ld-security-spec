  abstract = {Almost every company needs to process invoices to either claim money from their customers or to pay for products or services. Although companies are allowed to electronically process their invoices, most of them still rely on the paper-based invoice process. Within this paper we built upon existing work to develop a methodology for defining a reference model for the electronic invoice based on security patterns. This paper identifies threats of the e-invoice process in order to create a context for the security problem, which allows us to refine our methodology.},

  abstract = {Without appropriate counter-measures, cyber-attacks can exploit the increased system connectivity provided by Industry 4.0 (I4.0) to cause catastrophic events, by, e.g., injecting or tampering with messages. The solution supported by standards, such as, OPC-UA, is to sign or encrypt messages. However, given the limited resources of devices, instead of encrypting all messages in the network, it is better to encrypt only the messages that if tampered with or injected, could lead to undesired configurations. This paper describes the use of formal verification to analyse the security of I4.0 applications. We formalize in Rewriting Logic, I4.0 applications and systems, i.e., networked sets of devices, and a symbolic intruder model. Our formalization can be executed by the tool Maude to automate such security analysis, e.g., determine which messages are sufficient to sign in order avoid injection and tampering attacks.},

  abstract = {Currently Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) support most of the industrial manufacturing processes. The IT revolution has brought an important transformation in organizations with high impacts, which are comparable to the mechanization and electricity brought in the first and second industrial revolution. This evolvement has promoted the emergence of cloud-based systems, the Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, Industry 4.0, BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) and CYOD (Choose Your Own Device) trends. However, new technological solutions always carry security vulnerabilities, which most of time reveal unexpected risks. In fact, with increasing reliance on technology to gain competitive advantage, security issues have been one of the most critical and challenging requirements for conducting successful business. In this paper, it is highlighted some reflections regarding the challenges of Industry 4.0 emphasizing the security issues, towards raising awareness for security good practices within Industry 4.0.},

  abstract = {In this paper we describe the Unified Cybersecurity Ontology (UCO) that is intended to support information integration and cyber situational awareness in cybersecurity systems. The ontology incorporates and integrates heterogeneous data and knowledge schemas from different cybersecurity systems and most commonly used cybersecurity standards for information sharing and exchange. The UCO ontology has also been mapped to a number of existing cybersecurity ontologies as well as concepts in the Linked Open Data cloud. Similar to DBpedia which serves as the core for general knowledge in Linked Open Data cloud, we envision UCO to serve as the core for cybersecurity domain, which would evolve and grow with the passage of time with additional cybersecurity data sets as they become available. We also present a prototype system and concrete use cases supported by the UCO ontology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first cybersecurity ontology that has been mapped to general world ontologies to support broader and diverse security use cases. We compare the resulting ontology with previous efforts, discuss its strengths and limitations, and describe potential future work directions.},

  abstract = {The recent digital revolution led robots to become integrated more than ever into different domains such as agricultural, medical, industrial, military, police (law enforcement), and logistics. Robots are devoted to serve, facilitate, and enhance the human life. However, many incidents have been occurring, leading to serious injuries and devastating impacts such as the unnecessary loss of human lives. Unintended accidents will always take place, but the ones caused by malicious attacks represent a very challenging issue. This includes maliciously hijacking and controlling robots and causing serious economic and financial losses. This paper reviews the main security vulnerabilities, threats, risks, and their impacts, and the main security attacks within the robotics domain. In this context, different approaches and recommendations are presented in order to enhance and improve the security level of robotic systems such as multi-factor device/user authentication schemes, in addition to multi-factor cryptographic algorithms. We also review the recently presented security solutions for robotic systems.},
